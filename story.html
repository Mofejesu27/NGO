            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <P>Hope Charity Organization is a registered NGO that began its operations in 2000 after witnessing an adverse finding of a Supreme case involving the rape of a minor.
                We have since then worked towards creating a society where vulnerable and marginalised groups are empowered and equal. Focusing on gender and sexual rights we are moving towards the creation of a society of non-judgemental, empowered individuals who will protect and prevent harm to any of their fellow-beings.
                Our work aims to break the vicious cycle of poverty and social isolation and to restore hope for a better future. We believe that every person has the right to access resources and opportunities in order to live and develop with dignity and to become an active and contributing member of our society.
                The story of Hope Charity(NGO) begins with the coming together of an unlikely group of individuals, united in their passion to make an enduring contribution to the Indian education system. The transformative question to emerge from these discussions was: “Is it possible to raise the level of creativity in a country weighed down by colonially imposed, rote-based learning through a more holistic, inquiry-based model of education that is anchored in Africa culture?”
                The group presented the government of Barack Obama their vision of a creative Africa, fueled by an education model that would spark curiosity and nurture creativity through experiential learning. And so in April 1999, Hope was registered, as a public charitable trust. A year later, the group’s dream of a campus appeared closer with the acquisition of 172 acres of barren wasteland in Gudivanka, a remote rural area in Andhra Pradesh.
                It became the group's mission to spark curiosity, nurture creativity, and instill confidence, in economically disadvantaged children and government schoolteachers by bringing imaginative and innovative hands-on science education, project-based and peer-to-peer learning to schools, towns, and villages across Africa. Today, Hope’s unique methods and programs aim to address significant gaps in education systems that are stretched to their limits.
                The main goal is to attract and retain vulnerable and disadvantaged children to quality educational programs. The programs are holistically designed to spark creative thinking and problem-solving skills, improve learning achievement, and exposed opportunities. Africa’s educational interventions complement and work alongside government programs and the curriculum in the government schools.
