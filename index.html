        <p>
            It's easier to take than to give. It's nobler to give than to take. <br> 
            The thrill of taking lasts a day. The thrill of giving lasts a lifetime. <br>
            â€œMoney is not the only commodity that is fun to give. <br>
             We can give time, we can give our expertise, <br> 
             we can give our love, or simply give a smile. <br> 
             What does that cost? The point is, <br> 
             none of us can ever run out of something worthwhile to give."

            <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
            <p>
                Charity is important because it helps to improve the quality of life for others, <br> 
                build stronger communities, and support those who are in need. <br>
                Countless charities focus on sustainability and helping communities <br> 
                become more self-sufficient. Donated funds provide a strong foundation, <br>
                whether they're used for training programs, schools, and so on. <br>
                When sustainability is a priority, individuals and communities <br> 
                can support themselves and no longer depend on donations. <br>
                This benefits the world at large, so in that sense, <br>
                there is a return on the donations.
            </p>

                Charitable organizations are very effective at reducing poverty. <br> 
                This is thanks to a focus on the factors that contribute to poverty, <br>
                such as gender inequality and limited access to education. <br>
                Over the years, the poverty rate has been cut down significantly. <br> 
                In 2015, the 1990 poverty rate was cut in half five years ahead of schedule. <br>
                Charity played a big role in that achievement.
